Thought to use different modules and libraries of Python for each one of the sites.
But will be using now Selenium


******FOR DEVELOPERS******

First, made use of Python libraries like pytube, instaloader, etc. 

This worked well and as desired in the case of YouTube only.

Then, researched more to learn about Instagram & Facebook Graph API, and extracting data using Python. 
But I wanted to build something like application.

Then, I came to know about Selenium, this changed my entire approach. Now, the final version of this app uses web browser automation to get download links from different sites, and then download the media.
