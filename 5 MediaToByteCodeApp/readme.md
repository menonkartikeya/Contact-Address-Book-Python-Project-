This GUI is for the developers especially.
It comes in handy for encoding a media into printable ASCII characters (string).
So that the code can be further decoded and used whenever necessary.

It uses package "base64" for encoding purpose.
It is used to encode and decode : binary data and  ASCII character string.

Also, instructions are given inside the UI, for the developer on how to use the generated string.

Personally, this helps me a lot when I create an executable of my .py file 
which uses some sort of media (e.g. Image, Icon, Video) of ".jpg", ".png", ".ico", ".mp3", ".mp4", etc. types.
Then, the I use generated string variable in my .py source code (as instructed in the UI) to avoid adding extra data files and increasing complexity of procedure.
