Python Packages:
	pafy	                to extract that Youtube video		                              pip install pafy
	youtube-dl	          for pafy to work	with converting mp4 link into mp3           pip install youtube-dl
	vlc	                  to play the audio                                             pip install python-vlc
  And of course, tkinter and sqlite3

****THE CONCEPT****

Sometimes, don't you feel like listening to a song but then after you play it on YouTube,
you get busy in watching the video.
Or, after watching/listening to that, you play another video, then another.
And this becomes a loop. Your time is wasted and you now you won't feel like working anymore.

So, why not creating a playlist of your favorite songs/podcasts from thier YouTube links.
And then actually only "listening" to one of them, instead of "watching" them or repeatedly playing other videos.

AND HERE COMES MY THIS PROGRAM TO RESCUE:

First thing First, User needs to have a good internet connection.
->Stream songs, podcasts from YouTube, less distractingly.
->Listen to one audio once, then exit
->If want to listen more, select another audio.
->This would require manual work, so psycologically user won't again and again listen to songs continously.
  Instead, will exit after a while.	(YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON "EXIT")
->Hence the urge to listen to a song is fulfilled as well as a longer distraction is shortened.

The player (controller) window size is so compact and that you can just drag and drop it anywhere on screen. Click "Exit" button to stop the audio playing as well as close itself.
