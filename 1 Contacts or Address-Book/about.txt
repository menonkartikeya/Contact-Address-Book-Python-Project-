This program uses Python language with modules like tkinter, tkcalendar, csv, sqlite3, etc.
I had to work on GUI using Tkinter for front-end and database using sqlite for back-end.

This program:
    A. Helps user to enter, view and edit details of address book.
    B. Give information by printing out the list of contacts.

Some of the functionalities of this program:
    1. Help user keep all the contact details in an organized way in database.
    2. User can also export the data from contact database to .csv file locally
    3. The core of the program is a procedural programming algorithm (instead of object-oriented programming) 
        using several functions defined in code, that allows user to save, delete and update the contacts.
    4. User can make groups,
	 can change theme color according to their taste,
	 and can even delete entire contacts if they want to.
    5. This program works on every details like, there is a pop-up messagebox if user has left the first name entry field blank.
    6. First name field is compulsory to enter as it is what we use in order to search contacts.
    7. User is allowed to enter phone number not only in digits, i.e. also with characters such as "+1-234-234-3212 ". 
        This way, this interface makes user enter phone number in any format they wish.
